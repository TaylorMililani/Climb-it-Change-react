            <h4>This app gives you 2 workouts, 2 structured climbing sessions, 2 (short) antagonist workouts, and a free climbing day that you should aim to do every week in order to up your sends and keep yourself accountable to your climbing goals!</h4>
            <h4>It may seem like a lot, but the 2 antagonist workouts are pretty short and would ideally be tacked on to the end of a workout or climbing session. These workouts are designed to work your antagonist muscles (the muscles that don't get worked when you climb) in order to prevent injury and promote overall strength conditioning.</h4>
            <h4>With this app you can check off your weekly goals and stay focused! We keep track of how many workouts and climbing sessions you've checked off so you can see progress.</h4>
