Welcome to the frontend of Climb-it Change!

This application gives a user a training plan - Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced - for bouldering. The plan is structured with 2 workouts, 2 structured climbing sessions, 2 antagonist workouts, and a free climbing session per week. The user is able to set their level, get their plan, make a weekly schedule, and check off their weekly tasks. Google OAuth is implemented for a friendly user login.
